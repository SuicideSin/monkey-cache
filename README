Monkey Cache Plugin
=======================

This is a monkey web server plugin adds super fast jets to already
high speed monkey server. Its still in its initial stages and probably
doent cache enough to make any significant performance difference.

Status
======
Just bypasses the monkey static file serving and handles it on its own with
plain text mime type, it caches and its on par with kernel caching internally,
but its eagerly awaiting perf boost is still on the way

Installation
============

    # git clone git://git.monkey-project.com/monkey
    cd monkey
    git clone https://github.com/ziahamza/monkey-cache.git plugins/cache
    ./configure
    make
    ./bin/monkey

API Viewer
==========
Cache plugin exposes a json api to monitor and configure the plugin.
    # to use the api, make a get request to /cache/stats
    # ./bin/monkey
    curl localhost:2001/cache/stats
A simple web ui is also included, for now its pretty simple (just dumps the
api every second). To view it open the brower to /cache/webui/index.html
